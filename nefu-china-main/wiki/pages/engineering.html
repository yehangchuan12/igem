          <h2>Debt of Gratitude</h2>
          <p>AtheroSHuffle is not the work of one person, but a whole team endeavor including our team members, our instructor, and our sponsors. Our team members each filled their own roles and contributed to an incredible team dynamic which allowed us to persevere in the toughest of times. Our instructor Dr. Kozminski taught us what we needed, guided us through the process of iGEM, and helped to secure the funds needed to make our project possible. Finally, our sponsors are the source of funds integral to the success of our project, and very little would have been possible without them. We would like to thank each and every one of the names listed below for making the 2022 Virginia iGEM AtheroSHuffle project possible.</p>

Representatives from MITRE met with our team in the spring semester for lunch and we discussed each of our project proposals we were developing for the summer. MITRE covered our team’s registration fees for the iGEM competition, allowing us to focus more on our project and not worrying about raising funds to be able to attend iGEM. We thank MITRE for all of their financial support and hope to continue working with them in the future.</li>
